This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration and its solution.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from the loop condition `i <= arr.length`, which attempts to access an index beyond the array bounds.  The solution adjusts the loop condition to `i < arr.length`, ensuring correct array traversal.
